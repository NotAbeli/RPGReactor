/**
 * The map editor paints through surfaces it does not own.
 *
 * The region overlay and the 3D object overlay are each built around a
 * TilemapManager, and that is rebuilt per project — so a reference kept across
 * a project switch points at the map before last. The editor holds one of each.
 *
 * Reported as "I cannot paint object designations on map 242". The object
 * manager was handed to the editor only when the Objects tab was *clicked*, and
 * a tab that is already open is never clicked: open a project with that tab
 * selected, which is where the last session left it, and the editor was holding
 * the manager built for the previous project, or none at all. `paintTile`
 * checks for one and returns quietly when it is missing — no mark, no error, no
 * clue that a click had been received.
 *
 * Checked as source: the wiring lives across a controller, a palette and a DOM
 * that none of these tests stand up.
